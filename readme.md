How to Use
-----------------------

First, make sure you have installed:

1. git

2. Java JDK 7 or JDK 8 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

3. Eclipse 4.2 or higher (https://eclipse.org/)

First, clone the repository. This will make these files appear on your local machine. From Terminal, run: `git clone https://github.com/axc/bcode2015-scaffold.git`

Then, open Eclipse. Go to File->Import->General->Existing Projects into Workspace and then select bcode2015-scaffold. The source code for the players will be in the teams folder. To run the client, press the green play button.

Whenever there is a new release, you can either use the installer online (http://www.battlecode.org/contestants/releases/) or you can just pull from this repository (`git pull origin master`).

We recommend looking into setting up two remote repositories, so you can use a repository for your team while still getting updates. (http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes)
